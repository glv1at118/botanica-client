### What is Botanica?

Botanica is a fun full stack project designed and developed by me using the MERN techniques (Mongodb, Express.js, React.js/Redux.js, Node.js). In Botanica, a user/player can perform multiple interesting activities including but not limited to: Buying seeds and flower pots, planting new plants, taking care of plants, managing the warehouse, harvesting fruits, earn game coins, and writing diaries...... So fundamentally, this is a web application about plants and user's playground.



### Application Features

- **Every plant in Botanica is dynamic.** They will actually grow from a seed till they reach their ripeness and then produce fruits continuously. If it runs out of hydration it will actually die and get removed from the garden. The plants need your care often.
- **Each plant in Botanica comes with a specialty.** You will never know its specialty until you plant it in the garden. The specialty determines what the plant can offer you real-time. May it tell you a joke, get you the latest news world-wide, give you a tomorrow's weather forecast, or simply talk with you briefly? It's your time to discover. **Each plant will automatically pop up a dialog bubble when it "invokes its ability".**
- **Writing a diary is not free in Botanica** (Because the paper resource is scarce in the world of Botanica). Your plants is your mere source of in-app income. **Harvest more fruits and sell them later to gain coins.** Then you can consider to buy some diary paper to write down some important things.
- Abundance of choices: Up to 16 types of plant options, 10 types of vegetation pot options, and 4 kinds of plant-owned specialties, which comes to **a total number of 16 × 10 × 4 = 640 creature combinations.** The only limitation is your imagination!
- **Botanica's user save is stored in cloud** and will be synchronized (downloaded) automatically next time when the application is launched, meaning there will be no data loss. This is a full stack application which **requires an internet connection.** You can **log in a previous account or register a new account.**
